# METAR Lookup
A simple chrome extension that allows you to look up the weather at any airport.<br>
Weather data is pulled from the Aviation Weather Center data API.

## How to use
Simply enter in the 4 letter ICAO code of any airport to look up its METAR report.<br>
The extension gives the option to include a TAF report and to decode reports into plain English.
<b><p>
NOTE: decodings may not fully translate reports. METAR/TAF reports can include a huge variety of info. Right now the goal is to be able to fully decode ~80% of reports.

## Installation
Download the repo and load it in the upnacked extension into Chrome. <br>
